# Multiclass-Classification
example of multi-class classification using neural networks with tensorflow

Neural Networks are often used to classify data. Examples are neural networks:

-take in photos and classify subjects in the photos as {dog,cat,horse,other}
-take in a sentence and classify the 'parts of speech' of its elements: {noun, verb, adjective etc..}


A network of this type will have multiple units in its final layer. Each output is associated with a category. When an input example is applied to the network, the output with the highest value is the category predicted. 

We can implement trained parameters on a data set to classify different sets of data. 

I've included images of the output to show the training model on the dataset. 

NOTE: the scatter plot coloring may vary based on IDE but the code will run regardless, you can ignore any errors that are thrown due to this

NOTE 2: Softmax, ReLU will shared in the subsequent repository
